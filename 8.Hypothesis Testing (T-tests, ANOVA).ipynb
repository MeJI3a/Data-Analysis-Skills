    "# 8. Hypothesis Testing (T-tests, ANOVA): \n",
    "#### **Introduction**\n",
    "This project applies hypothesis testing techniques, including T-tests and ANOVA, to analyze datasets for statistical relationships. The goal is to explore whether differences in group means are statistically significant, using two datasets: customer shopping data and synthetic transaction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Objectives**\n",
    "1. **T-Test**: Compare the means of two groups (e.g., gender, transaction volume) to identify significant differences.\n",
    "2. **ANOVA**: Analyze variance among three or more groups (e.g., shopping malls, customer categories) to detect significant mean differences.\n",
    "3. Summarize findings and evaluate their implications.\n",

    "1. **Customer Shopping Data**:\n",
    "   - No significant difference in quantities purchased by gender or in average prices across shopping malls.\n",
    "2. **Transaction Data**:\n",
    "   - No significant difference in profit between high and low transaction days.\n",
    "   - No strong evidence of differences in sales across customer categories, although a trend towards significance was observed.\n",

    "These results suggest that at the 0.05 significance level, the analyzed factors do not strongly impact the measured outcomes. Further data or alternative methods may be required for deeper insights.\n"
